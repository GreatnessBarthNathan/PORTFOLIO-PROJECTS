        <p>Hi, my name is Bartholomew Ekemezie.</p>
        <p>I am a Front-End Web Developer and I love to build things.</p>
        <p>
          I learnt how to code by learning the very basics, from HTML, CSS &
          JAVASCRIPT, to REACT, REDUX and even FIREBASE.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about programming and I love to learn by building cool
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>I help businesses and organizations to:</p>
        <li>Develop new user-facing features...</li>
        <li>Determine the structure of their web pages...</li>
        <li>Build reusable codes...</li>
        <li>Use a variety of markup languages to create your web pages...</li>
        <p>
          If you need the Guy that gets the work done on any of these, I'll be
          happy to talk. <br /> <br /> Have any doubts? Please head to my
          projects to see for yourself.
